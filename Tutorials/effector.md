# The Effector

This on eactually gave a ton of trouble due to a  [ <font size="30"> FDM printer's </font>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication) issue with printing accurate very small gears. This caused the peice to have too much friction and it could barely move. I actually ended up printing the effector on a resin printer and between this and a better powersupply that can supple 1 amp per servo we finally got movement out of the effector peice.
