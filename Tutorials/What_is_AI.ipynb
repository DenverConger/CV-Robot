While the learning part of A.I is summed up often as Machine Learning. A.I is often a summation of parts, learning and making decisions.\n","\n","![Circles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sai-byui/Tutorial/main/photos/IBM.webp \"layered circles\")\n","\n","## AI can be very simple\n","All examples shown in tutorial here on out were captured on my computer\n","![A.I](https://github.com/sai-byui/Tutorial/blob/main/photos/Animation.gif?raw=true \"The A.I as you can see follows the player VERY simply\")\n","```python\n","    if pixelis != 255:\n","            keyboard.press(\"space\")\n","            time.sleep(0.01)\n","            keyboard.release(\"space\")\n","```\n","Lets look at the Learning and Decisions, the 2 parts working together to form this A.I\n","\n","\n","In this case the Learning aspect was Hard Coded by me: A pixel color change is detected at the point shown on the frame \n","\n","And the Decision is to jump when the change is detected\n","  <br/>\n","  <br/>\n","  <br/>\n","  <br/>\n","  <br/>\n","\n","# Lets dive a bit deeper into these 2 aspects\n","\n","# Learning\n","\n","## `Machine Learning`\n","\n","![Circles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sai-byui/Tutorial/main/photos/IBM.webp \"layered circles\")\n","\n","\n"," It is based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
