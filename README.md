# Planning
My plan with this robot is to take it in steps and to increase my understanding of complex robotics and A.I step by step as I get better with it.
Firstly all three of these plans will use the ROS system but with increased complexity

1. Use the Robot to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. (The task planning for this would be simple because you as the designer know the desired outcome and the steps it needs to do to get there.
2. Use the Robot to play Chess against a Player. This will increase the task planning and decision making by quite a bit while still keeping it within the realm of supervised learning. I have already finished the portion of the A.I regarding to playing chess. The real issue is implementing this physically.
3. Lastly I want to explore the unsupervised realm more by seeing If i can build a robot that trains itself to recognize3 and organize blocks using unsupervised learning techniques.

The current plan is to use Object detection with a camera above to have a robotic arm

# Things to get
1. Figure out how to do a camera stand
2. zip ties (Cable Management)


# SHORT TERM PLAN
1. Learn ROS in more detail
2. Get a servo to be controlled with solely the ROS and (arduino)
3. Learn machine learning programming
4. Neural network understanding
5. begin to tackle individual parts

**REMINDER**

    THIS IS A MASSIVE PROJECT THAT WE AM ACTIVELY WORKING ON
    please understand that this is a long term project (like potentially upwards of a year)

    I want to use this to fully understand every facet of higher robotic 
    concepts and how to utilize them to create a "smart" robot
# Long term Learning Plan  
Research ideas (aka things to learn while in this process)
### Common Robotic systems

notes on an overall process MIT uses to create comp[lex decision makin robotics

ROS or Robotoc Operating system is a big goal of ours for this project. I want to learn how to use it well

        Sub wiki articles good to know about

where i created my own steps from this link


### Kinematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_kinematics
A good understanding of physics and specifically kinematics and how rigid structures with jointss are affected


This is basically doing the math to say when I move motor n, the system moves in Cartesian (x, y, z) by (i, j, k). 
This applies the other way too, where if you want to move i in x direction, you may need to move multiple motors together.


### MediaPipe?
