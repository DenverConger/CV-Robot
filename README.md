# Planning
The current plan is to use Object detection with a camera above to have a robotic arm organize objects by either shape or color into certain areas avalible to it.


## Neural Networks

## Machine Learning

# Things to get
1. Figure out how to do a camera stand
2. zip ties (Cable Management)


# SHORT TERM PLAN
1. Learn ROS in more detail
2. Get a servo to be controlled with solely the ROS and (arduino)
3. Learn machine learning programming
4. Neural network understanding
5. begin to tackle individual parts

**REMINDER**

    THIS IS A MASSIVE PROJECT THAT WE AM ACTIVELY WORKING ON
    please understand that this is a long term project (like potentially upwards of a year)

    I want to use this to fully understand every facet of higher robotic 
    concepts and how to utilize them to create a "smart" robot
# Long term Learning Plan  
Research ideas (aka things to learn while in this process)
### Common Robotic systems
http://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/
notes on an overall process MIT uses to create comp[lex decision makin robotics

ROS or Robotoc Operating system is a big goal of ours for this project. I want to learn how to use it well
http://wiki.ros.org/
        Sub wiki articles good to know about
        http://wiki.ros.org/smach

https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2020/07/29/open-problems-in-robotics/
where i created my own steps from this link


### Kinematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_kinematics
A good understanding of physics and specifically kinematics and how rigid structures with jointss are affected

(i found the following explaination for robotic kinematicsonline)
This is basically doing the math to say when I move motor n, the system moves in Cartesian (x, y, z) by (i, j, k). 
This applies the other way too, where if you want to move i in x direction, you may need to move multiple motors together.


### MediaPipe?
https://github.com/google/mediapipe


### This is the robot we will be modifying for our needs
